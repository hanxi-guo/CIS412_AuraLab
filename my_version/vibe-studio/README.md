## AI Usage Declaration

### AI-Generated Content
This project includes the following AI-generated content:

1. **Default Facebook Post Caption** (`src/App.jsx`, line 40-41)
   - The default caption for the Facebook post was generated by ChatGPT
   - Marked with: `(all the sentences here is generated by ChatGPT here for instruction used)`

2. **AI Vibe Analysis & Feedback Modules** (`src/App.jsx`, lines 42-53)
   - Example AI analysis text for "Tone Consistency," "Vibe Cluster," and "Detected Mood"
   - Example AI feedback with target audience matching table
   - These are **placeholder templates** ready for API integration

### AI-Assisted Code Implementation
- AI tools were used to accelerate and initialize React component structure, CSS styling, and code optimization based on our design specifications
- We handle the debugging and all post-generation processes following the initial structured output of the AI-generated code ourselves.

### Important Note
The AI analysis sections are currently **static placeholders** waiting for real API integration. They demonstrate the intended user experience but do not make actual API calls to AI services yet.
